# Tech Talk: Boosting Productivity with VSCode ðŸš€

I want to share some tips and tricks that make my workflow faster and smoother. Hopefully, youâ€™ll find something useful, and maybe I can convince some of you to try VSCode too.
Why VSCode? I think it's a minimal text editor that you can customize to your liking. Plus, a big percentage of the developers are using it, which makes it easy to collaborate with your team.
