# Tech Talk: Boosting Productivity with VSCode ðŸš€

I want to share some tips and tricks that make my workflow faster and smoother. Hopefully, youâ€™ll find something useful, and maybe I can convince some of you to try VSCode too.
Why VSCode? I think it's a minimal text editor that you can customize to your liking. Plus, a big percentage of the developers are using it, which makes it easy to collaborate with your team.

### Global configuration
- **Choose a dark colored theme** - better for the eyes.
- **Sidebar to the right**: more screen space, less distraction.

### Hotkeys

- **`CTRL+BACKTICK`**: Open up terminal
- **`CMD+B`**: Open up side panel
- **`CMD+P`**: Open file explorer
- **`CMD+R`**: Open recent projects
- **`CMD+K+V`**: Open recent projects

**Mac-only shortcuts**: `CTRL+CMD+F`, `CTRL+LEFT/RIGHT_ARROW`

### Testing and debugging configuration
- Setting up the test explorer
